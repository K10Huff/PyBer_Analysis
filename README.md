# PyBer_Analysis

# Overview of the Analysis 
The purpose of the analysis was to illustrate the differences in ride-sharing among the different city types.

# Results
As can been seen in the summary images, urban riders outspend both suburban and rural communities in Total Rides and Total Fares. However, rural customers spend more on individual rides and the rural drivers average 3.5x more than their urban counterparts per ride.

# Summary: 
Business recommendations to the CEO include:
1.  In the rural communities, where it might be difficult to recruit drivers, focus on the higher average fare per driver metric as a recruiting point.
2. Increase recruitment of drivers in Urban areas in early January to meet demand as it slowly increases from the beginning of the year. 
3.  Gather and analyze average fare data from alternate transportation options to compare to PyBerâ€™s average fare to see if decreased cost is a selling point to entice new customers.
